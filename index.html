        I am a student of Bachelor Of Computer Applications at Maulana Abul
        Kalam Azad University Of Technology. Since a young age, I was
        interested on Computer and their various technologies. So when I was
        grown enough, I have realized that I want to pursue a career in the
        field of IT and make my contribution in the industry which is add some
        value to people. Currently I am started to learning Java and Python
        with data structures and alogorithms. I have also polishing my skills
        on the field of frontend development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I
        constantly searching for new opportunities to learn some new skills
        and technologies. Every day I try to be more better from the previous
        day. Besides I love to solve programming problems that eventually
        helps to solves a real world problem.
